# Summary

This notebook documents approaches to predicting outcomes using set-based trait features with publicly available microbiome data sets. We're not interested in surveying which method is the best, but rather to compare across different (but related) feature sets within a similar approach. As such, we did not tune the hyperparameters of the random forest but rather using standardized parameter setups.
